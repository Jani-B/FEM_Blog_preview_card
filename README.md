# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card

![Design preview for the Blog preview card coding challenge](./preview.jpg)


## The challenge

Challenge to build Blog preview card with CSS and HTML
In the challenge there was figma file which to follow. 
Nothing too special on this challenge. Basic challenge for beginners such as I.

## what was challenging

Small challenge was that I first missed the small changed on mobile version of the figma design. There was no border for the image and I think it had a max height given on mobile version.

There is probably much better way to make all the fonts etc work on the layout. I think it would be better to create a different font versions in CSS as a class and add the correct class to the HTML objects.
